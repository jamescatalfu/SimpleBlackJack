				            Welcome to Blackjack!

				                  Objective
In this simplified version of the classic casino card game, you will play against the
dealer to see who can get closest to 21 without going over.
 
                                   Scoring
Cards numbered 2 - 10 are worth their face value, face cards(jacks, queens, and kings) are
worth 10 and aces are worth 11. If the player or the dealer goes over 21, it will be a
bust and the opposite player will automatically win. If an ace is dealt with a 10 card or
any face card, it is a Blackjack which is an automatic win, unless the opposite player
also has Blackjack in which case it will be a draw. The number of wins for each player
will also be displayed at the bottom of the scoreboard at the beginning of each person's
turn and the end of each game.

                                 How to Play
The player and the dealer will be dealt two cards each. The current score of the dealer
and the player will be shown at the beginning of each hand. The player will go first. The
player will be shown its hand and will be presented with the option to hit or stand. If
hit is chosen, the player will be dealt another card, and the new score will be
determined. If stand is chosen, the current score will be saved and the dealer's turn will
begin. The dealer is required to hit as long as the score is less than 16. The dealer must
stay once the current score gets to 16 or higher.
